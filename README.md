# cmp_cmpress

`cmp_cmpress` is a commandline tool which compresses data using Sega's CMP [run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) compression format, which was commonly used in Sega Saturn games. This tool aims to be 100% compatible with Sega's original decoder; you should be able to use its output to replace files in retail Saturn games.

This tool uses the [`sega_cmp`](https://github.com/studio-lucia/sega_cmp) Rust crate, which is based on [@MrConan1](https://github.com/MrConan1)'s C tool [CMP_CMPRESS](https://github.com/MrConan1/CMP_CMPRESS). This commandline tool reimplements all of that tool's options exactly. Aside from some minor differences in how the CLI help works, they should behave exactly the same.

## Usage

At its most basic, you can just run `cmp_cmpress <input_file> <output_file>`. There are a few options which control the output:

* `-t` - Selects the compression size. Defaults to byte (8-bit) encoding, which is the most common format used in Saturn games. 16-bit and 32-bit encoding are also supported.
* `-f` - Specifies an offset to start at when reading data from the input file. Useful if you only want to compress part of a file.
* `-s` - Specifies the number of bytes to read from the input file. If not specified, the file will be read to the end. Useful if you only want to compress part of a file.

For example, here's the most basic usage:

```
$ cmp_cmpress input.bin output.bin
```

## Installing

To install from source, just run `make install`; this will install the binary to `/usr/local`. You can also specify a different location to install to by specifying the `PREFIX` option, such as `make install PREFIX=/opt/local`.
